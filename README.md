# Autopsy Billing

Generate list of autopsies that need to be invoiced. The scripts in this project generate a list of autopsies that need to be billed. The list is provided to Jaimi for validation and invoicing. This is a stop-gap effort while we transition from the manual method previously used for autopsy billing and into the current tech-billing process.
